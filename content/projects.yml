    During the kickoff hackathon for my fellowship program with Major League Hacking (MLH), my team and I were tasked with building a portfolio and blog Flask application. 

    I designed a mockup of the application using Figma. I also worked on the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
    
    In the following weeks, we were tasked with continuing work on the application individually. I set up an AWS EC2 instance and containerized the application and database using Docker.
